    <em><strong>An opinionated SaaS starter template to hit the ground running</strong></em>
  </p>
</p>

_This project is built with [Startline](https://github.com/adelrodriguez/startline)._

Startline is an opinionated, batteries-included starter template to build SaaS applications using (my current favorite) technologies. The stack is built around [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and serverless technologies.

### The stack includes:

- Internationalization
- Error tracking
- Authentication
- Background jobs
- Rate limiting
- Email delivery
- Caching
- Payments
- File uploads
- Analytics
- Environment variable validation

## Technologies

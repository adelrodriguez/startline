    <em><strong>An opinionated SaaS starter template to hit the ground running</strong></em>
  </p>
</p>

_This project is built with [Startline Web](https://github.com/adelrodriguez/startline-web)._

Startline is an opinionated, batteries-included starter template to build SaaS applications using (my current favorite) technologies. The stack is built around [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and serverless technologies.

### The stack includes:

- Internationalization
- Error tracking
- Authentication with database-backed sessions
- Background jobs
- Rate limiting
- Email delivery
- Caching
- Payments
- File uploads
- Analytics
- Environment variable validation

## Technologies

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) as our React framework
- [Drizzle ORM](https://drizzle.dev) as our ORM
- [Neon](https://neon.tech) as our serverless Postgres database
- [Conform](https://conform.guide) for form handling
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling
- [ShadcnUI](https://ui.shadcn.com) as the component library
- [Resend](https://resend.com) for email delivery, with [React Email](https://react.email) for templating
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com) for payment processing
- [Upstash Redis](https://upstash.com) for serverless caching and rate limiting, and [Upstash Qstash](https://upstash.com/qstash) for serverless job queue
- [Sentry](https://sentry.io) for error tracking
- [PostHog](https://posthog.com) for analytics
  - [Plausible](https://plausible.io) is also supported
- [UploadThing](https://uploadthing.com) for file uploads
- [next-intl](https://next-intl-docs.vercel.app/) for internationalization
- [nuqs](https://github.com/47ng/nuqs) to manage state in search params

### ...plus some other stuff to make development a breeze:

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) for the package manager, shell for executing scripts and running tests
- [Drizzle Kit](https://drizzle.dev/kit) for migrations and studio
- [Biome](https://biomejs.dev) for formatting and linting
- [Taze](https://github.com/antfu/taze) for dependency management
- A Docker Compose file for local development (database and Redis)
- GitHub Action to keep the template in sync with the latest version of Startline

## Getting started

TODO

## Decisions

### Neon

WIP. Basically I'm planning on using Postgres for all the `startline` projects. That will mean Supabase for `startline-mobile` and Neon for `startline-web`. Basically eliminating the need to keep track of multiple database technologies as I switch between projects.

## TODOs

- [ ] Move this to be modular: we don't need to have everything installed from the get-go. Each part of the starter could be installed using the setup script.
- [ ] Add information to the README about why we chose certain technologies over others.
